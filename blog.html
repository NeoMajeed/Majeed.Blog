                <p>Full accessibility of knowledge, streamlined management, and creating more incentives to
                    learn through gamification and rewards are among the achievements of educational institutions that are embracing
                    blockchain technology. Schools, Colleges, and Universities must take their first steps to innovation and integrate
                    blockchain if they are to survive in such a competitive environment.</p>
                <h2>What is blockchain?</h2>
                <p>In simple terms, blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger that stores information and keeps track of
                    transactions. Each and every member of the blockchain community has its own copy of the information. The information
                    is recorded subsequently into units called blocks and protected by strong cryptography, creating a chain of data.
                    Changes to blocks are not permitted by the blockchain system architecture, so every action and event could be traced
                    to its origins.</p>
                <p>A blockchain could store data on agreements between the parties, their credentials, transactions, and any other
                    information presented in a digital form. Since this information is distributed and highly secured, any attempt at
                    fraudulent activity can be seen by the members of the blockchain community. This creates trust and transparency for
                    any type of ecosystem that the blockchain is integrated into.</p>
